## 4. Universal HW + Licensing

Platform ONE delivers full-portfolio universal hardware and licensing with no bricking, a free tier, and the lowest lock-in in the industry. Cisco's CW-series APs now offer Meraki-vs-Catalyst mode flexibility, but only for wireless — switches remain separate product lines and Meraki-mode devices still brick without license.

- **Full-Portfolio Universal HW** — APs *and* switches work cloud, on-prem, or hybrid. Cisco's CW-series covers APs only; switches are still siloed
- **Free Tier** — XIQ Connect provides cloud management at no cost
- **No Bricking** — Hardware fully functional without active license. Cisco CW APs under Meraki management still shut down 30 days after license expiry
- **Low Lock-In** — Export configs, switch management modes, keep your hardware
- **Consumption Billing** — Subscription, perpetual, or consumption-based pricing options
