# Top 5 Differentiators

Extreme Networks' five key competitive advantages — backed by data from the Competitive Intelligence Dashboard.

---

## 1. Privacy Certification

[[Extreme Networks]] is the only enterprise networking vendor to hold ISO 27701 Privacy Information Management certification.

- **ISO 27701** — Only networking vendor with Privacy Information Management certification (GDPR/CCPA aligned)
- **ISO 42001** — First and only networking vendor pursuing AI Management System certification for CoPilot
- **ISO 27017** — Cloud-specific security controls held by very few competitors
- **SOC 2 Type II + CSA STAR** — Full trust assurance coverage
- **FedRAMP / GovRAMP** — Active pursuit for US Federal and SLED markets

## 2. Fabric Connect

Fabric Connect (IEEE 802.1aq SPB) is a native, no-overlay campus fabric.

- **No overlay complexity** — MAC-in-MAC encapsulation stays in native Ethernet frames
- **IS-IS only** — No BGP expertise needed; campus teams operate from day one
- **Hours to deploy** — Zero-touch auto-discovery vs days/weeks for EVPN-VXLAN
- **10+ years proven** — 50,000+ customers including NFL, Bundesliga, US DoD
- **No extra cost** — Fabric Connect included in EXOS; no per-switch subscription

## 3. ENERGY STAR Sustainability

36 ENERGY STAR certified switch models — more than all other vendors combined.

- **36 ENERGY STAR Models** — More certified switches than all competitors combined
- **80 PLUS Platinum PSUs** — Industry-leading power supply efficiency across enterprise switches
- **Lowest Wi-Fi 7 AP Power** — AP5020 draws just 21W typical, the lowest of any enterprise Wi-Fi 7 AP
- **Federal EO 14057** — Meets US Federal sustainability procurement mandates
- **EU Green Procurement** — Qualified for sustainability-scored enterprise and public-sector RFPs

## 4. Universal HW + Licensing

Platform ONE delivers universal licensing with no hardware bricking, a free tier, and the lowest lock-in in the industry. Same AP and switch hardware works cloud, on-prem, or hybrid — customers choose and can switch at any time. Cisco now offers Catalyst-vs-Meraki mode flexibility on CW-series APs and Catalyst 9300/9200/9500H switches, but Meraki-mode devices still brick without license, Meraki MS switches cannot migrate to Catalyst Center, and no Cisco option works license-free.

- **License-Free Operation** — Hardware fully functional without any active license. Cisco Catalyst/Meraki mode flexibility still requires DNA or Meraki licensing; Meraki mode bricks 30 days after expiry
- **Free Tier** — XIQ Connect provides cloud management at no cost — no Cisco equivalent
- **True 3-Mode Flexibility** — Cloud, on-prem (XIQ-SE), or hybrid on the same hardware. Cisco offers Catalyst Center vs Meraki Dashboard but not a true on-prem-equivalent third option
- **Low Lock-In** — Export configs, switch management modes, keep your hardware. Meraki MS switches still cannot migrate to Catalyst Center (one-way only)
- **Consumption Billing** — Subscription, perpetual, or consumption-based pricing options

## 5. CoPilot & AI Expert (Platform ONE)

Extreme Platform ONE combines CoPilot (AIOps and Digital Twin) with AI Expert — the industry's first networking platform with conversational, multimodal, and agentic AI in a single solution. CoPilot handles anomaly detection and natural-language troubleshooting; AI Expert adds multimodal canvas, autonomous agents, and cross-domain intelligence.

- **CoPilot AIOps** — Explainable ML-driven anomaly detection, proactive alerts, and natural-language troubleshooting across wired and wireless
- **AI Expert Canvas** — Multimodal AI canvas generates real-time dashboards, shareable insights, and visual reports via natural language (Platform ONE)
- **Autonomous AI Agents** — Service, Advisor, Validation, and Health agents with human-in-the-loop design — up to 98% faster resolution (Platform ONE)
- **Digital Twin** — CoPilot's pre-deployment network validation — virtually stage devices before pushing to production
- **Cross-Domain Scope** — AI Expert spans network ops, security, procurement, compliance, CVEs, and third-party integrations (Platform ONE)
