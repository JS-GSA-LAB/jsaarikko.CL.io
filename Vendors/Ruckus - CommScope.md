## Licensing

- **Model:** Flexible (Perpetual + Subscription)
- **Mandatory:** No
- **Free Tier:** No
- **Hardware Works Without License:** Yes
- **Tiers:** Ruckus One ($120-150/dev/yr cloud) or SmartZone (perpetual on-prem)
- **Lock-In:** Medium-Low — Choice between cloud subscription and perpetual on-prem. Hardware works with either model.
- **Exit Cost:** Low-Medium — Standard hardware. SmartZone perpetual provides on-prem safety net. Moderate migration effort.

## TCO Summary

> Scenario: 100 APs / 50 Access Switches / 5 Core Switches / 10 SD-WAN Sites

| Component | Cost |
|-----------|------|
| Hardware Total | $609,225 |
| Mgmt Platform | $0 |
| Annual License | $23,250/yr |
| Annual Support | $35,000/yr |
| **3-Year TCO** | **$783,975** |
| **5-Year TCO** | **$900,475** |

**Hardware:** APs: 100x R770 @ $1,595 | Access: 50x ICX 7550-48 @ $6,995 | Core: 5x ICX 7850-48C @ $19,995 | SD-WAN: N/A

**Licensing:** Ruckus One: 100 APs @ $150/yr = $15,000 + 55 switches @ $120/yr = $6,600. SmartZone on-prem alternative (perpetual). Total cloud: ~$23,250/yr.

**Support:** CommScope WatchDog: ~$35,000/yr. Standard support + software maintenance.

## Hidden Costs

| Cost Category | Amount | Risk |
|---------------|--------|------|
| Training & Certification | $2,000-$8,000 | MEDIUM |
| Professional Services | $5,000-$20,000 | LOW |
| Migration Complexity | Medium | MEDIUM |
| Multi-Platform Tax | Moderate | MEDIUM |
| License True-Up Surprises | $3,000-$8,000/yr | LOW |
| Vendor Lock-In Risk | Medium-Low | LOW |

- **Training & Certification** ($2,000-$8,000): Ruckus certifications. Platform transition (SmartZone → Ruckus One) requires retraining.
- **Professional Services** ($5,000-$20,000): Straightforward deployments. Strong wireless expertise in channel.
- **Migration Complexity** (Medium): CommScope restructuring creates platform uncertainty. SmartZone to Ruckus One migration.
- **Multi-Platform Tax** (Moderate): No SD-WAN — need third-party solution for WAN. Two management planes.
- **License True-Up Surprises** ($3,000-$8,000/yr): Simple cloud pricing. SmartZone perpetual option provides predictability.
- **Vendor Lock-In Risk** (Medium-Low): Standard hardware. SmartZone perpetual option. But CommScope future strategy unclear.
