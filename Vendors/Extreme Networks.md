# Extreme Networks

> **Cloud-driven, AI-powered end-to-end networking**
> Flagship: ExtremeCloud IQ, Universal Hardware

## Extreme Differentiators
- **Universal Hardware Architecture** — Single AP and switch hardware platform that works with any management mode — cloud, on-prem, or hybrid — without hardware swap.
- **Cloud-Native from Day One** — ExtremeCloud IQ built as a true cloud-native, microservices platform. No bolt-on cloud overlay on legacy controllers.
- **Infinite Licensing Flexibility** — Perpetual, subscription, or consumption-based licensing. No forced subscription lock-in for basic features.
- **Fabric Connect** — Industry-leading SPB-based network fabric for automated, simplified campus and data center segmentation — no overlay complexity.
- **CoPilot AI / Digital Twin** — AI-driven network insights with ExtremeCloud IQ CoPilot and full digital twin for pre-deployment validation.
- **Open Ecosystem & APIs** — RESTful APIs, Terraform provider, Ansible modules, and an open standards approach (OpenConfig, LLDP-MED).
