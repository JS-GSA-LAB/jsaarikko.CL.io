## Value Scores

| Dimension | Score (1-10) |
|-----------|-------------|
| Feature Completeness | 9 |
| Cloud & AI Innovation | 10 |
| Licensing Flexibility | 6 |
| Deployment Simplicity | 8 |
| Support Quality | 8 |
| Ecosystem & Integration | 7 |

## Licensing

- **Model:** Required Subscription
- **Mandatory:** Yes
- **Free Tier:** No
- **Hardware Works Without License:** Yes
- **Tiers:** Wired Assurance ($100/sw/yr) + Wireless Assurance ($150/AP/yr) + WAN Assurance
- **Lock-In:** Medium — Mist cloud subscription required for AI features. Junos-based hardware works standalone with reduced functionality.
- **Exit Cost:** Medium — Standard Junos CLI/config. Hardware has secondary market value. Clean subscription model easy to forecast.

## TCO Summary

> Scenario: 100 APs / 50 Access Switches / 5 Core Switches / 10 SD-WAN Sites

| Component | Cost |
|-----------|------|
| Hardware Total | $654,575 |
| Mgmt Platform | $0 |
| Annual License | $41,500/yr |
| Annual Support | $42,000/yr |
| **3-Year TCO** | **$905,075** |
| **5-Year TCO** | **$1,072,075** |

**Hardware:** APs: 100x AP47 @ $1,799 | Access: 50x EX4400-48T @ $7,495 | Core: 5x QFX5120-48T @ $15,995 | SD-WAN: 10x SSR120 @ $1,995

**Licensing:** Wireless Assurance: 100 APs @ $150/yr = $15,000 + Wired Assurance: 55 switches @ $100/yr = $5,500 + WAN Assurance: 10 @ $175/mo = $21,000. Marvis included. Total: ~$41,500/yr.

**Support:** Juniper Care: ~$42,000/yr. Next-business-day or 24x7 options.

## Hidden Costs

| Cost Category | Amount | Risk |
|---------------|--------|------|
| Training & Certification | $5,000-$15,000 | MEDIUM |
| Professional Services | $10,000-$40,000 | MEDIUM |
| Migration Complexity | Medium | MEDIUM |
| Multi-Platform Tax | Low | LOW |
| License True-Up Surprises | $3,000-$10,000/yr | LOW |
| Vendor Lock-In Risk | Medium | MEDIUM |

- **Training & Certification** ($5,000-$15,000): Junos certification track. Mist is simpler but Junos CLI has learning curve.
- **Professional Services** ($10,000-$40,000): EVPN-VXLAN fabric can require PS. Mist wireless is simpler.
- **Migration Complexity** (Medium): Standard Junos configs. EVPN-VXLAN is industry-standard. Good secondary market.
- **Multi-Platform Tax** (Low): Unified Mist cloud for all Juniper networking.
- **License True-Up Surprises** ($3,000-$10,000/yr): Clean per-device subscription. Marvis included. Predictable billing.
- **Vendor Lock-In Risk** (Medium): Mist cloud dependency. But Junos is standards-based and hardware retains value.
