## Licensing

- **Model:** Required Subscription
- **Mandatory:** Yes
- **Free Tier:** No
- **Hardware Works Without License:** Yes
- **Tiers:** Central Foundation ($75-110/dev/yr) → Central Advanced ($150-165/dev/yr)
- **Lock-In:** Medium — Subscription required for cloud management. Hardware can operate standalone but loses cloud features.
- **Exit Cost:** Medium — AOS-CX is standards-based. Hardware retains value. Migration effort moderate.

## TCO Summary

> Scenario: 100 APs / 50 Access Switches / 5 Core Switches / 10 SD-WAN Sites

| Component | Cost |
|-----------|------|
| Hardware Total | $554,225 |
| Mgmt Platform | $0 |
| Annual License | $42,625/yr |
| Annual Support | $38,000/yr |
| **3-Year TCO** | **$796,100** |
| **5-Year TCO** | **$957,350** |

**Hardware:** APs: 100x AP-735 @ $1,695 | Access: 50x CX 6300F 48G @ $5,495 | Core: 5x CX 8360 32Y @ $18,995 | SD-WAN: 10x EC-S @ $1,500

**Licensing:** Central Advanced: 100 APs @ $165/yr = $16,500 + 55 switches @ $150/yr = $8,250 + 10 SD-WAN @ $125/mo = $15,000. Total: ~$42,625/yr.

**Support:** Aruba Foundation Care: ~$38,000/yr. 24x7 support + software updates.

## Hidden Costs

| Cost Category | Amount | Risk |
|---------------|--------|------|
| Training & Certification | $3,000-$10,000 | MEDIUM |
| Professional Services | $15,000-$50,000 | MEDIUM |
| Migration Complexity | Medium | MEDIUM |
| Multi-Platform Tax | Low | LOW |
| License True-Up Surprises | $5,000-$15,000/yr | MEDIUM |
| Vendor Lock-In Risk | Medium | MEDIUM |

- **Training & Certification** ($3,000-$10,000): Aruba certifications. ClearPass requires specialized training.
- **Professional Services** ($15,000-$50,000): Dynamic Segmentation and ClearPass deployments often need PS.
- **Migration Complexity** (Medium): AOS-CX is modern and standards-based. Reasonable migration path.
- **Multi-Platform Tax** (Low): Unified Aruba Central for wired + wireless + WAN.
- **License True-Up Surprises** ($5,000-$15,000/yr): Foundation vs Advanced tier confusion. ClearPass licensing separate.
- **Vendor Lock-In Risk** (Medium): ClearPass creates stickiness. HPE acquisition adds uncertainty. But AOS-CX is open.
