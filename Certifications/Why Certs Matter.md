# Why Certs Matter

Security and compliance certifications are not just checkboxes — they directly impact whether a vendor can compete for regulated, government, and enterprise deals.

## ISO/IEC 27001

**Impact:** HIGH

The global gold standard for information security management. Required by most enterprise RFPs and government procurement. Proves the vendor has systematic controls protecting customer data across people, processes, and technology.

> **Extreme Networks:** Extreme was among the first network cloud platforms to achieve ISO 27001 (Oct 2019).

---

## ISO/IEC 27017

**Impact:** HIGH

Extends ISO 27001 with cloud-specific security controls covering shared responsibility, data segregation, and virtualization security. Critical for enterprises evaluating cloud-managed networking where sensitive traffic metadata flows to the cloud.

> [!tip] Extreme Networks Differentiator
> Extreme is the ONLY cloud networking vendor with ISO 27017 certification — a key differentiator for cloud security-conscious customers.

---

## ISO/IEC 27018

**Impact:** HIGH

Establishes controls for protecting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in public cloud environments. Based on ISO 27002 with additional cloud privacy controls, it addresses data processor obligations including consent, transparency, data portability, and sub-processor oversight. Critical for enterprises routing user traffic metadata through cloud-managed networking platforms.

> **Extreme Networks:** Extreme does not currently hold ISO 27018. ALE (Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise) is the only networking vendor with this certification via their OpenRainbow cloud platform.

---

## ISO/IEC 42001

**Impact:** MEDIUM

The first international standard for AI Management Systems, published December 2023. Provides a framework for responsible AI development, deployment, and use — covering risk assessment, transparency, bias mitigation, and human oversight. Increasingly relevant as networking vendors embed AI/ML into cloud management platforms (e.g., AIOps, digital twins, anomaly detection). The EU AI Act and similar regulations are driving enterprise demand for formal AI governance certification.

> **Extreme Networks:** Extreme is actively pursuing ISO 42001 certification for ExtremeCloud IQ CoPilot — no other networking vendor has achieved or announced pursuit of this standard. First-mover advantage in AI governance as the EU AI Act drives enterprise demand.

---

## ISO/IEC 27701

**Impact:** HIGH

The privacy extension to ISO 27001, directly aligned with GDPR and CCPA requirements. Demonstrates the vendor has formal privacy information management covering data collection, processing, and deletion rights.

> [!tip] Extreme Networks Differentiator
> Extreme is the ONLY cloud networking vendor with ISO 27701 — critical for healthcare, finance, and EU customers requiring formal privacy controls.

---

## SOC 2 Type II

**Impact:** HIGH

Independent auditor attestation that the vendor meets Trust Services Criteria for security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy over a sustained period (typically 6-12 months). Unlike Type I (point-in-time), Type II proves ongoing operational effectiveness.

> **Extreme Networks:** Extreme maintains SOC 2 Type II attestation with continuous monitoring and annual renewal.

---

## FedRAMP Moderate

**Impact:** HIGH

Required for cloud services used by US Federal agencies. Based on NIST SP 800-53 with 325+ security controls. Once achieved, provides a government-wide authorization to operate (ATO), dramatically simplifying procurement for all federal customers.

> **Extreme Networks:** Extreme is actively pursuing FedRAMP Moderate authorization — a top priority for its growing US Federal business.

---

## GovRAMP

**Impact:** MEDIUM

Formerly StateRAMP, GovRAMP is the state/local government equivalent of FedRAMP. Increasingly required by US state agencies, K-12 school districts, and higher education institutions for cloud services. Leverages FedRAMP controls adapted for SLED procurement.

> **Extreme Networks:** Extreme is pursuing GovRAMP to serve the growing SLED market alongside its FedRAMP effort.

---

## FIPS 140-2 / 140-3

**Impact:** HIGH

Mandatory for any product handling sensitive government data. Validates that cryptographic modules (encryption, hashing, key management) meet federal standards. Without FIPS validation, a vendor is automatically disqualified from US Federal, DoD, and many regulated industry deployments.

> **Extreme Networks:** Extreme switches (5420, 5520, X-series) carry FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic modules. FIPS 140-3 validation is in progress.

---

## Common Criteria (NDcPP)

**Impact:** MEDIUM

International mutual recognition agreement across 31 nations. The Network Device collaborative Protection Profile (NDcPP) evaluates network infrastructure security. Required by many defense and intelligence community procurements worldwide.

> **Extreme Networks:** Extreme products support Common Criteria evaluated configurations for applicable platforms.

---

## Wi-Fi 7 Certified

**Impact:** MEDIUM

Official Wi-Fi Alliance certification ensures interoperability with the entire Wi-Fi 7 ecosystem. Without certification, vendors may claim Wi-Fi 7 support but lack validated interoperability — risking compatibility issues in mixed-vendor environments.

> **Extreme Networks:** The AP5020 is Wi-Fi 7 certified by the Wi-Fi Alliance, ensuring validated interoperability.

---

## MACsec (802.1AE)

**Impact:** MEDIUM

Layer 2 encryption between switches, protecting data in transit across the campus LAN. Critical for zero-trust architectures where physical network access cannot be assumed secure. Prevents eavesdropping, MITM attacks, and data injection on wired networks.

> **Extreme Networks:** Extreme provides MACsec across access AND uplink ports on the 5320, 5420, 5520, and 7520YE series — many competitors only support uplinks.

---

## TAA Compliance

**Impact:** HIGH

The Trade Agreements Act restricts US Government purchases to products manufactured in designated countries. Non-TAA-compliant products are automatically excluded from GSA Schedule and government contract procurement, regardless of technical capability.

> **Extreme Networks:** All Extreme enterprise products are TAA compliant, ensuring eligibility for US Government procurement.

---

## CSA STAR

**Impact:** MEDIUM

The Cloud Security Alliance STAR registry provides transparency into cloud provider security practices. Level 1 requires self-assessment against the Consensus Assessments Initiative Questionnaire (CAIQ). Demonstrates proactive security transparency beyond basic certifications.

> **Extreme Networks:** Extreme maintains CSA STAR Level 1 — publicly available security assessment for customer due diligence.

---

## C5 (BSI)

**Impact:** HIGH

The Cloud Computing Compliance Criteria Catalogue (C5) is mandated by the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI). It is required for cloud services used by German federal agencies and increasingly by private sector organizations across the DACH region (Germany, Austria, Switzerland). C5 attestation demonstrates compliance with 114 security criteria covering organization, physical security, cryptography, and operations.

> **Extreme Networks:** Extreme is actively pursuing C5 attestation for ExtremeCloud IQ — essential for expanding its DACH public sector and regulated enterprise footprint.

---

## ISMAP

**Impact:** HIGH

ISMAP is required for cloud services used by Japanese government agencies. Established by Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) and other ministries, it evaluates cloud providers against security controls aligned with international standards. Without ISMAP registration, vendors are effectively excluded from Japanese public sector cloud procurement.

> **Extreme Networks:** Extreme is actively pursuing ISMAP registration for ExtremeCloud IQ — critical for Japanese government and enterprise networking opportunities.

---

## IRAP

**Impact:** HIGH

IRAP is required for cloud services processing Australian government data up to PROTECTED classification. Assessed by ASD-certified assessors against the Australian Government Information Security Manual (ISM). Without IRAP assessment, vendors are effectively excluded from Australian federal, state, and defense procurement.

> **Extreme Networks:** Extreme is actively pursuing IRAP assessment for ExtremeCloud IQ — critical for Australian government and defense networking opportunities.
