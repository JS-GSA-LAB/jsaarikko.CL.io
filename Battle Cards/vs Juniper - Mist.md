# vs Juniper - Mist

> Battle card for competing against **Juniper - Mist** (AI-driven enterprise networking)

## Their Strengths — How to Counter

### 1. "Marvis is the best AI assistant in networking"

> [!info] Their Claim
> Juniper will heavily promote Marvis AI as the most advanced conversational AI for network operations, with proactive insights and virtual network assistant capabilities.

> [!tip] Counter-Argument
> Marvis IS impressive, and Juniper/Mist deserves credit for AI innovation. However, ExtremeCloud IQ CoPilot provides comparable conversational AI capabilities plus Digital Twin for pre-deployment validation — something Marvis doesn't offer. More importantly, Marvis requires a Mist cloud subscription; CoPilot is one tier above free Navigator.

**Proof Points:**
- XIQ CoPilot provides natural language queries comparable to Marvis
- Digital Twin for pre-deployment validation is unique to Extreme
- CoPilot builds on free Navigator tier — gradual upgrade vs. mandatory subscription
- Extreme's AI roadmap is accelerating with continuous CoPilot enhancements
- For customers who don't need AI, Extreme's free Navigator tier provides basic management — Juniper has no equivalent

**Discovery Questions:**
- Does Mist offer a free management tier for customers who don't need AI?
- Can Marvis validate a configuration change in a digital twin before production deployment?
- What's the annual cost of Mist Wireless Assurance + Wired Assurance for 100 APs and 50 switches?

### 2. "Junos is the most reliable network operating system"

> [!info] Their Claim
> Juniper will emphasize Junos's reputation for stability, modular architecture, and carrier-grade reliability built over 25+ years.

> [!tip] Counter-Argument
> Junos is excellent for routing and data center use cases — but for campus switching, it's over-engineered. EXOS (Extreme's OS) is purpose-built for campus networking with simpler operations. Junos's BGP-heavy EVPN-VXLAN fabric requires routing expertise that most campus network teams don't have.

**Proof Points:**
- EXOS is purpose-built for campus — simpler than Junos for campus operations
- Fabric Connect (SPB) doesn't require BGP expertise unlike Juniper's EVPN-VXLAN
- Junos learning curve is steep — CCNA-level engineers find Junos challenging
- EXOS provides modular, compartmentalized processes similar to Junos architecture
- Extreme's ExtremeCloud IQ reduces the need for CLI expertise regardless

**Discovery Questions:**
- How many of your existing campus network engineers have Junos certification?
- What's the typical training investment to bring a team up to speed on Junos?
- Is BGP expertise required for Juniper's campus fabric? How many campus teams run BGP today?

### 3. "EVPN-VXLAN is the industry-standard campus fabric"

> [!info] Their Claim
> Juniper positions EVPN-VXLAN as the future of campus networking, aligning campus architecture with data center patterns.

> [!tip] Counter-Argument
> EVPN-VXLAN originated in data centers and works well there. For campus networks, it introduces unnecessary complexity — BGP route reflectors, VXLAN tunnel endpoints, and data center design patterns that campus teams aren't built to manage. Fabric Connect (SPB) was designed for campus from day one and delivers equivalent segmentation and automation with dramatically less operational overhead.

**Proof Points:**
- EVPN-VXLAN campus requires BGP expertise — rare in campus networking teams
- SPB auto-discovers topology and auto-provisions — EVPN-VXLAN requires explicit configuration
- Fabric Connect campus deployments: hours. EVPN-VXLAN campus deployments: days/weeks
- IEEE 802.1aq (SPB) is as standard as EVPN-VXLAN — both are industry standards
- Gartner recognizes both approaches; customer should choose based on operational simplicity for THEIR team

**Discovery Questions:**
- How many campus-only networks are you running EVPN-VXLAN on today (not data center)?
- What does the training path look like for a campus team adopting EVPN-VXLAN with BGP?
- Can you do a live demo of EVPN-VXLAN campus fabric deployment in under an hour?

## When They Attack Extreme

### 1. "Extreme's AI is behind Juniper/Mist — CoPilot is immature"

> [!warning] Their Attack
> Juniper reps will claim Marvis has years of AI head start and CoPilot is a newcomer.

> [!tip] Counter
> Marvis launched earlier, but CoPilot is closing the gap rapidly. More importantly, CoPilot includes Digital Twin — a capability Marvis lacks. And the bigger question is value: Juniper requires paid Assurance subscriptions for ANY management. Extreme provides free cloud management with Navigator, making CoPilot an optional upgrade rather than a mandatory cost.

**Proof Points:**
- CoPilot Digital Twin has no Marvis equivalent
- Free Navigator tier provides cloud management without any AI premium cost
- CoPilot's natural language capability is production-ready and continuously improving
- AI is only as good as the data and actions it can take — CoPilot integrates with Fabric Connect actions
- Customer can start with free Navigator and upgrade to CoPilot when ready — try-before-you-buy

**Discovery Questions:**
- Can we start with free Mist management and add AI later? What's the minimum entry cost?
- Does Marvis offer digital twin for pre-deployment validation?
- What's the annual recurring cost for Mist Assurance for our deployment size?

### 2. "Extreme has a smaller switching portfolio than Juniper (no QFX-class DC switches)"

> [!warning] Their Attack
> Juniper may highlight their QFX and PTX data center portfolio as proof of broader switching capability.

> [!tip] Counter
> For campus networking — which is the primary battlefield — Extreme's switching portfolio is comprehensive and competitive. Extreme's SLX 9000 series covers data center needs, and Fabric Connect provides a simpler campus fabric than Juniper's EVPN-VXLAN. In a campus-focused evaluation, Extreme's portfolio is a strength, not a weakness.

**Proof Points:**
- Extreme 5520/5720 series covers campus access and aggregation comprehensively
- SLX 9000 series serves data center switching needs
- Fabric Connect provides campus fabric without DC-oriented complexity
- Most campus evaluations don't require QFX-class spine switches
- Extreme's campus switching + wireless + fabric integration is tighter than Juniper's

**Discovery Questions:**
- Is this deployment primarily campus or data center? (If campus, DC portfolio is irrelevant)
- Does your campus team have the Junos/BGP expertise to operate QFX switches?
- What's the TCO comparison for campus-only switching between Juniper EX and Extreme 5520?

---

## Summary

Against Juniper/Mist, lead with **operational simplicity** and **free management entry point**. Acknowledge Marvis AI quality but counter with CoPilot + Digital Twin and the free Navigator tier. The fabric debate (SPB vs EVPN-VXLAN) is your strongest technical differentiator for campus-focused deals. **Key killer questions**: Ask what their minimum management cost is (Juniper: paid subscription; Extreme: free). Ask if Marvis has Digital Twin. Ask how many campus engineers on their team have BGP experience for EVPN-VXLAN.
