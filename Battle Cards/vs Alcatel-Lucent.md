# vs Alcatel-Lucent

> Battle card for competing against **Alcatel-Lucent** (SPB fabric networking for campus and enterprise)

## Their Strengths — How to Counter

### 1. "We use the same SPB fabric standard as Extreme — IEEE 802.1aq"

> [!info] Their Claim
> ALE will position their SPB implementation as equivalent to Extreme's Fabric Connect, arguing that the underlying IEEE standard is identical.

> [!tip] Counter-Argument
> The IEEE 802.1aq standard is the same, but implementation maturity matters enormously. Extreme has deployed Fabric Connect at 1,000+ switch scale with 50,000+ customers. Extreme's cloud management (XIQ with CoPilot AI), Fabric auto-attach for wireless, and Digital Twin are all capabilities that ALE's OmniVista cannot match.

**Proof Points:**
- Extreme has 1,000+ switch Fabric Connect deployments; ALE maxes around 500
- ExtremeCloud IQ CoPilot AI has no equivalent in OmniVista
- Fabric auto-attach seamlessly integrates wireless into the fabric
- Digital Twin provides pre-deployment validation — OmniVista lacks this
- Extreme's Universal Hardware means cloud, on-prem, or hybrid mgmt on same gear

**Discovery Questions:**
- What is your largest SPB fabric deployment by switch count?
- Does OmniVista offer AI-powered operations like Extreme CoPilot?
- How do your APs integrate with the SPB fabric?

### 2. "ALE is strong in education, hospitality, and government"

> [!info] Their Claim
> ALE will highlight their strong vertical presence, especially in education and hospitality, with long-standing customer relationships.

> [!tip] Counter-Argument
> Extreme also has deep presence in education, government, hospitality, and sports/entertainment — but with a broader portfolio and superior cloud management. Extreme's ExtremeCloud IQ with CoPilot AI, Digital Twin, and free Navigator tier provide more value in these verticals where IT teams are often lean.

**Proof Points:**
- Extreme serves education, government, hospitality, and sports (NFL, FIFA, Bundesliga)
- Free XIQ Navigator is ideal for budget-constrained verticals
- CoPilot AI helps lean IT teams operate complex networks
- Fabric auto-attach simplifies wireless deployment for understaffed IT
- Extreme's Universal Hardware reduces complexity for smaller teams

**Discovery Questions:**
- What is the annual cost of OmniVista Cirrus vs Extreme's free Navigator tier?
- How does OmniVista help lean IT teams with AI-powered operations?
- What pre-deployment planning tools does ALE offer?

### 3. "OmniSwitch provides a unified wired/wireless campus solution"

> [!info] Their Claim
> ALE will position their OmniSwitch + OmniAccess Stellar portfolio as a complete unified campus solution managed through OmniVista.

> [!tip] Counter-Argument
> ALE's portfolio covers the basics but lacks modern capabilities. No Wi-Fi 7 yet, no AI-powered radio management, no digital twin, no SD-WAN, limited automation/DevOps tooling, and weaker cloud management maturity compared to Extreme's XIQ.

**Proof Points:**
- ALE has no Wi-Fi 7 APs yet — Extreme AP5020 is shipping
- No CoPilot AI or comparable AIOps in OmniVista
- No Digital Twin for pre-deployment validation
- No native SD-WAN solution
- Limited REST API and automation ecosystem
- OmniVista Cirrus is less mature than ExtremeCloud IQ

**Discovery Questions:**
- When will ALE ship Wi-Fi 7 access points?
- What AI/ML capabilities does OmniVista provide for network operations?
- What is ALE's SD-WAN strategy?

## When They Attack Extreme

### 1. "Extreme is more expensive than ALE"

> [!warning] Their Attack
> ALE reps may position their hardware as lower-cost and their OmniVista pricing as competitive.

> [!tip] Counter
> When comparing total cost of ownership, Extreme's free XIQ Navigator tier, included Fabric Connect (no additional license), and Universal Hardware flexibility often results in lower TCO. ALE's OmniVista Cirrus subscription ($120/device/yr) adds up quickly. And Extreme provides significantly more capability — AI CoPilot, Digital Twin, Fabric auto-attach — for comparable or lower cost.

**Proof Points:**
- ExtremeCloud IQ Navigator is free — OmniVista Cirrus is $120/device/yr
- Fabric Connect included in EXOS — no additional fabric license
- Over 3 years, Extreme's free management tier saves $55K+ on a 155-device deployment
- CoPilot AI, Digital Twin, and Fabric auto-attach add value without additional cost
- Extreme hardware pricing is competitive with ALE for comparable models

**Discovery Questions:**
- What is the 3-year TCO including OmniVista Cirrus subscriptions?
- Is SPB fabric included in the base AOS license or an add-on?
- What does your AI-powered management cost per device?

---

### 2. "ALE's Unified Access is simpler than Extreme's approach"

> [!warning] Their Attack
> ALE may argue their Unified Access architecture is simpler to deploy and manage.

> [!tip] Counter
> Extreme's Fabric auto-attach actually provides simpler wireless integration with the fabric — APs automatically join the fabric and receive I-SID segmentation. XIQ CoPilot's AI assistant makes operations simpler by answering questions in natural language. And Extreme's Universal Hardware means the same device works with any management mode.

**Proof Points:**
- Fabric auto-attach = zero-touch wireless fabric integration
- CoPilot AI provides natural language network troubleshooting
- Universal Hardware works with cloud, on-prem, or hybrid — same device
- XIQ Navigator free tier means no management subscription required
- Extreme has 50,000+ customers demonstrating operational simplicity

**Discovery Questions:**
- Can OmniVista answer network troubleshooting questions in natural language?
- How do ALE APs integrate with the SPB fabric — is it truly zero-touch?
- Can ALE hardware switch between cloud and on-prem management without hardware changes?

---

## Summary

Against ALE, the battle is **SPB vs SPB — same fabric, different ecosystem**. Both use IEEE 802.1aq, so the fabric protocol is not the differentiator. Instead, lead with Extreme's superior ecosystem: **XIQ CoPilot AI** (no ALE equivalent), **Digital Twin** (no ALE equivalent), **Fabric auto-attach** for wireless, **free Navigator management** (vs paid OmniVista Cirrus), and **Wi-Fi 7** (ALE has no Wi-Fi 7 yet). Emphasize Extreme's larger proven scale (1,000+ vs 500+ switches) and broader portfolio including SD-WAN. **Key killer questions**: Ask about AI capabilities, Wi-Fi 7 timeline, SD-WAN strategy, and 3-year TCO including management subscriptions.
